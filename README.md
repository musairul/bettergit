BetterGit transforms the Git experience with intuitive commands, interactive menus, and human-readable output. Say goodbye to cryptic Git commands and hello to a version control system that actually makes sense.




## üéØ Why BetterGit? See The Difference

**One command, multiple superpowers:**

| Traditional Git | BetterGit Magic |
|----------------|-----------------|
| `git init` + `git remote add origin...` + `gh repo create...` | `bit init` does ALL of this + GitHub repo creation + automatic setup |
| `git reset --soft HEAD~1` + `git branch -d name` + `git revert abc123` | `bit undo` handles ALL reversals + safe confirmations + interactive recovery |
| `git checkout main` + `git checkout -b feature` + `git checkout abc123` | `bit switch` handles ALL of these + account switching + interactive menus |
| `git log --oneline` + `git branch -a` + `git stash list` | `bit list` shows everything + command history + interactive selection |

**Workflows that just work:**

```bash
# Start a new project (Traditional Git: 5+ commands)
bit init my-project                # ‚Üí Creates repo locally AND on GitHub
                                  # ‚Üí Sets up remote automatically  
                                  # ‚Üí Opens in your editor

# Work on any issue (Traditional Git: lookup issue, create branch manually)
bit workon 123                     # ‚Üí Auto-creates descriptive branch
                                  # ‚Üí Links to GitHub issue
                                  # ‚Üí Switches you there instantly

# Clone anything (Traditional Git: find URL, clone, setup)
bit clone                         # ‚Üí Shows YOUR repos with descriptions
                                  # ‚Üí Detects GitHub URL in clipboard
                                  # ‚Üí Auto-opens in editor after clone
```

**Every command is interactive** 

Never guess what to do again. Just type the command by itself

```bash
bit switch                         # Interactive menu: branches, commits, accounts
bit list                          # Choose: saves, branches, history, accounts  
bit undo -i                          # Smart menu: undo commits, delete branches, fix ANY mistake
bit clone                         # Your repos + clipboard detection + auto-setup
```

## üéØ Core Superpowers

### üîÑ `bit switch` - The Ultimate Navigation

**Never remember syntax again.** One command handles everything:

```bash
bit switch                        # Interactive menu shows:
                                 # ‚úÖ All branches (local & remote)
                                 # ‚úÖ Recent commits  
                                 # ‚úÖ Account switching
                                 # ‚úÖ Create new branch option

# Or be specific if you want:
bit switch main                   # Switch to main branch
bit switch new-feature -c         # Create and switch to new branch
bit switch work-account           # Switch to work GitHub account
bit switch abc123                 # Go to specific commit
```

### üìã `bit list` - Universal Explorer  

**One command to see everything** in your repository:

```bash
bit list                         # Interactive menu:
                                # ‚úÖ Recent saves (commits)
                                # ‚úÖ All branches
                                # ‚úÖ Your command history
                                # ‚úÖ Configured accounts
                                # ‚úÖ Stashed changes

# Or jump directly:
bit list saves                   # Beautiful commit history
bit list branches               # All branches with descriptions
bit list accounts               # Switch between work/personal
```

### üèóÔ∏è `bit init` - Project Creation Wizard

**Stop wrestling with setup.** From idea to working repo in one command:

```bash
bit init my-amazing-project      # Does EVERYTHING:
                                # ‚úÖ Creates local Git repo
                                # ‚úÖ Creates GitHub repository
                                # ‚úÖ Sets up remote connection
                                # ‚úÖ Creates initial commit
                                # ‚úÖ Opens in your editor
```

### ‚Ü©Ô∏è `bit undo` - The Ultimate Safety Net

**Made a mistake? No problem.** BetterGit can undo ANYTHING safely:

```bash
bit undo                         # Interactive menu shows:
                                # ‚úÖ Recent commits to undo
                                # ‚úÖ Branches to delete
                                # ‚úÖ Actions to reverse
                                # ‚úÖ Safe revert options

# Undo specific things:
bit undo abc123                  # Undo a specific commit (safely)
bit undo feature-branch          # Delete a branch (with protection)
bit undo -i                      # Interactive mode - choose what to undo
```

**Never fear Git again** - BetterGit tracks everything and can reverse any operation safely, with confirmations and protection for important branches.

### Safety Features

BetterGit prioritizes safety without sacrificing power:

- **Confirmation prompts** for destructive operations
- **Protected branches** (main, master, develop) require extra confirmation  
- **Action history** tracks all operations for easy undo
- **Dry run modes** for preview before execution
- **Smart error messages** with suggested solutions

### GitHub Integration

#### Repository Management
```bash
bit init my-project                 # Creates local repo and offers GitHub creation
bit clone                           # Lists your repositories with descriptions
```

#### Pull Request Workflow
```bash
bit pr create -t "Fix bug"          # Create PR with title and body
bit pr list                         # List all PRs with status
bit pr checkout 42                  # Checkout PR #42 locally
```

#### Issue Workflow
```bash
bit workon 123                      # Create branch for issue #123
                                   # Auto-generates descriptive branch name
```

<summary><strong>üìä Traditional Git vs BetterGit Comparison</strong></summary>

### Before (Traditional Git)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git checkout -b feature
git branch -d old-branch  
git log --oneline --graph
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

### After (BetterGit)
```bash
bit save "message"                  # Replaces add + commit
bit switch feature -c               # Create and switch in one command
bit undo old-branch                 # Delete with safety checks
bit list saves                      # Human-readable history
bit undo                            # Smart undo with history
```
