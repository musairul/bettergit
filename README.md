## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bettergit.git
cd bettergit

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Make BetterGit available globally (optional)
pip install -e .
```

### Your First Repository

```bash

bit tutorial
```

## üìñ Core Concepts

### üíæ Saves (Commits)
Think of saves like checkpoints in a video game:

```bash
bit save "Fixed login bug"           # Save all changes
bit save file.py "Updated logic"     # Save specific files
bit save                             # Interactive mode
```

### üîÑ Switching
Navigate between different states of your project:

```bash
bit switch main                      # Switch to main branch
bit switch feature-login             # Switch to feature branch
bit switch new-feature -c            # Create and switch to new branch
bit switch abc123                    # Go to specific commit
```

### üìã Listing
Explore your project with interactive menus:

```bash
bit list                             # Interactive menu
bit list saves                       # Recent commits
bit list branches                    # All branches
bit list history                     # Your recent actions
```

### ‚Ü©Ô∏è Undoing
Fix mistakes with confidence:

```bash
bit undo                             # Undo last action
bit undo -i                          # Interactive undo menu
bit undo abc123                      # Undo specific commit
bit undo feature-branch              # Delete specific branch
```

# User accounts - seamlessly switch between identities
accounts:
  work:
    name: "John Smith"
    email: "john@company.com"
  personal:
    name: "John"
    email: "john@personal.com"

defaults:
  editor: "code"                    # Your preferred editor
  main_branch_name: "main"          # Default branch name
  repo_visibility: "private"        # Default repo visibility

# Current active account
current_account: "work"
```

Edit configuration:
```bash
bit config                          # Opens config in your default editor
```

## üîß Advanced Workflows

```bash
# Switch between work and personal accounts
bit switch work-account
bit switch personal

# Each switch updates git config for the repository
# Credentials are stored securely per account
```

### Interactive Clone Workflow

```bash
bit clone                           # Shows smart menu with:
                                   # ‚úÖ Auto-detected clipboard URLs
                                   # ‚úÖ Your GitHub repositories
                                   # ‚úÖ Auto-opens in configured editor
```

### Targeted Undo Operations

```bash
# Undo specific commits
bit undo abc123                     # Interactive options:
                                   # - Revert commit (safe, keeps history)
                                   # - Interactive rebase (rewrites history)

# Delete specific branches  
bit undo feature-branch             # Smart deletion with:
                                   # - Current branch protection
                                   # - Protected branch warnings
                                   # - Remote branch cleanup
```

### Repository Maintenance

```bash
bit cleanup                         # Interactive cleanup:
                                   # - Delete merged branches
                                   # - Prune stale remotes  
                                   # - Run garbage collection

bit cleanup --dry-run               # Preview what would be cleaned
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

BetterGit prioritizes safety without sacrificing power:

- **Confirmation prompts** for destructive operations
- **Protected branches** (main, master, develop) require extra confirmation  
- **Action history** tracks all operations for easy undo
- **Dry run modes** for preview before execution
- **Smart error messages** with suggested solutions

### Safety Levels
- **Low**: Proceed automatically
- **Medium**: Simple yes/no prompt  
- **High**: Clear warning with confirmation
- **Extreme**: Require typing the target name

## ü§ù GitHub Integration

### Repository Management
```bash
bit init my-project                 # Creates local repo and offers GitHub creation
bit clone                           # Lists your repositories with descriptions
```

### Pull Request Workflow
```bash
bit pr create -t "Fix bug"          # Create PR with title and body
bit pr list                         # List all PRs with status
bit pr checkout 42                  # Checkout PR #42 locally
```

### Issue Workflow
```bash
bit workon 123                      # Create branch for issue #123
                                   # Auto-generates descriptive branch name
```

## üìä Why BetterGit?

### Before (Traditional Git)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git checkout -b feature
git branch -d old-branch  
git log --oneline --graph
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

### After (BetterGit)
```bash
bit save "message"                  # Replaces add + commit
bit switch feature -c               # Create and switch in one command
bit undo old-branch                 # Delete with safety checks
bit list saves                      # Human-readable history
bit undo                            # Smart undo with history
```
